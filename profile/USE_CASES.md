# Real-World Use Cases

Alpine Networks is designed to empower local communities with simple, 
resilient, and affordable communication systems. Here are a few example 
scenarios that demonstrate how these technologies can work in the real 
world:

---

## :cow2: Automated Milk Pickup Notification (Machine-to-Machine - 
## :Reticulum)

A dairy farmer in a remote alpine village uses a sensor connected to a 
local Reticulum node. Once the milk reaches the right temperature and 
volume, the system sends a small data packet over a local mesh network 
to the village cooperative's shared terminal. No internet, no cloud, just 
a low-power, automated signal handled entirely within the community 
network.

This allows:
- Fully offline, automated coordination  
- Zero reliance on cloud services  
- Energy-efficient, local-first digital logistics

## :boot: Trail Coordination Between Cabin and Guide (Person-to-Person -
## :Meshtastic)

A hiking guide leading a group through a high-altitude trail checks in 
with a mountain cabin to confirm weather and timing. Using low-cost LoRa 
devices running Meshtastic, short encrypted messages are exchanged 
across rugged terrain—well outside of 5G range.

This setup enables:
- Safe, low-bandwidth coordination  
- No reliance on cellular or satellite networks  
- Affordable devices (~€35) with no recurring fees

## :grey_question: Why Not Just Use 5G or Starlink?

While high-bandwidth solutions like 5G or Starlink do cover many areas, 
they come with: 

- High infrastructure costs 
- Centralized control 
- Subscription fees often inaccessible to low-income or small-scale operations

Alpine Networks doesn’t aim to replace these services—but to **stand 
beside them**, offering an **independent, community-owned layer** of 
connectivity that works when the others don’t, or simply aren’t viable.
